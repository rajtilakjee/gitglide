# GitGlide
Discover your Code Crush!

GitGlide is an innovative FOSS app designed to revolutionize the way developers discover exciting projects on GitHub.

Think of GitGlide as Tinder for developers. Just like the popular dating app which matches you with potential dates, GitGlide presents you with curated GitHub repositories based on your interests and skills. Swipe right if a project piques your interest, swipe left if it doesn’t sound intriguing enough. It’s that simple!

But GitGlide goes beyond simple swiping. As you continue to use the app, it’s AI-powered recommendation engine learns your preferences and tailors the projects you see. This means you’ll spend less time sifting through irrelevant repositories and more time making meaningful contributions to projects. You will also be able to save interesting projects for later consideration. Build your own personalized collection of potential contributions, allowing you to revisit them when you’re ready to dive in.
